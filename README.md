# YouTube Grid Screen Saver

YouTube Grid is a cross-platform screensaver that will display YouTube videos in a grid. Share a collection of retro video games, music videos, movie trailers, or other themed video sets played in a randomized grid to customize your machine when it is locked!

## How It Works

YouTube Grid is a cross platform screensaver that allows you to download YouTube videos by simply providing a valid YouTube URL in the Settings/Config window. Videos are downloaded and stored in a cache so be aware of disk usage. Add a few videos and then hit Preview or wait for your screensaver to start and watch the show!

# YouTube Grid Screen Saver

YouTube Grid is a cross-platform screensaver that will display YouTube videos in a grid. Share a collection of retro video games, music videos, movie trailers, or other themed video sets played in a randomized grid to customize your machine when it is locked!

## Getting Started

This project is an active work in progress. TBD!
